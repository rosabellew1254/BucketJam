  - "I set out to fix some of the various repairs that need to be done around the
    house this month. It\u2019s hard work, especially the roof repairs, but anything
    I can do to make Clove more comfortable is worth it."

  - "I went out near the flower fields to try and bring some back for Clove, but
    most of them looked sickly. It was sad to see the field in that state, but I
    did manage to find a few that were still in full bloom! I had to be pretty careful
    when picking them though, I could\u2019ve sworn they tried to bite me."

  - "Clove has been asking questions during the past month about the new crops I\u2019ve
    been growing. I\u2019m glad she seems interested in my work but I do wish she
    would stop asking about how to dispose of them. I\u2019m only trying to help
    her after all."
