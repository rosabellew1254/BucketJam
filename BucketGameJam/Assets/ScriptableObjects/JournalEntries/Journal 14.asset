  - "I couldn\u2019t resist keeping a few of my crops to try out cooking again. Clove
    was always the one making our meals before falling ill. It was a complete disaster\u2026

  - "I can\u2019t say I\u2019m a huge fan of bugs, but something is definitely wrong
    with the spiders near the shed. They\u2019re a lot bigger than others that I\u2019ve
    seen and I swear the web I tried to dust off cut me. Maybe it\u2019s time to
    break out a broom and some bug killer."

    the infernal thing has been stalking my crops for the last time. Meat has been
    scarce ever since the rancher \u201Cdisappeared\u201D. Perhaps it\u2019s time
    to set out some traps\u2026"
