  - Looking around the shop I noticed a few saplings for sale this month and was
    reminded about how Clove and I would climb whatever tree we could get our hands-on.
    Maybe I should think about growing a few trees on the farm, it might be fun to
    have some close to home!

  - "I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s been going on but the houses nearest the well
    look like they\u2019re\u2026 melting? It\u2019s difficult to describe but I doubt
    they\u2019re safe to live in anymore. I\u2019ve asked a few of the residents
    if they need help with repairs but they seem to think it\u2019s perfectly normal.
    Maybe it\u2019s best to steer clear just in case they collapse."

  - "I\u2019ve been beating some of the books in the house in order to allow Clove
    to read them. I\u2019ve found quite a few of them scooting away when she\u2019d
    reach for one and cause her to scream. I don\u2019t want her to become bored
    so it\u2019s better that they learn their place."
