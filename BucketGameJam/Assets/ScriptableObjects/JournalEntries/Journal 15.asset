  - "From what I can tell my plan to combat the mice has been working with the help
    of my new feline friend! I\u2019ve noticed a big decrease in the rodents lately
    and have seen the stray hanging around the fields. I should start leaving out
    some water for him so he won\u2019t go thirsty. Thanks for the help little guy!"

  - "The weeds have gotten more difficult to pull up lately. Their root systems have
    gotten tougher and I think they\u2019re starting to\u2026 squirm? It feels like
    they are gripping onto the dirt. Maybe I should think about looking for some
    weed killers."

  - "I\u2019ve tried cooking meals out of my crops for Clove this month. Perhaps
    they will help her in ways that medicine never could. Unfortunately, she refused
    my cooking again and again, I even tasted it myself and everything. Can\u2019t
    she see I\u2019m just trying to help?"
