  - "Tis\u2019 the season for bird migrations, which also means I need to be on guard!
    I\u2019ve made some repairs to my trusty partner, the scarecrow. I\u2019m again
    reminded that my sewing skills need some help, but maybe my scary stitching will
    help keep some of the birds away."

  - "I\u2019ve passed by the ranch quite a few times this month to chat with the
    rancher. He seems nervous about something but I\u2019m not really sure what.
    Though looking at the cows I might have a few ideas\u2026"

  - "I paid a visit to the ranch in order to purchase some meat but couldn\u2019t
    find the rancher. The cows seem to have grown quite the appetite though and the
    air stunk of copper. Perhaps that would explain where he\u2019s gone."
