  - "Browsing around some tools in the shop made me realize how old a few of mine
    are and I was tempted to buy some new ones. But I resisted! If it isn\u2019t
    broken or I can\u2019t fix it then I\u2019ll think about it again but right now
    every penny needs to go towards that medicine!"

  - "The mice have been more relentless and it\u2019s becoming quite a problem. I\u2019ve
    seen the cat manage to hunt a few of them but he\u2019s been avoiding them recently.
    After taking a look at them myself I can\u2019t really blame the poor thing,
    their teeth seemed to have sharpened somehow. Maybe I\u2019ll give the cat some
    food as a thanks for his efforts."

  - "Pandora tells me that my crops have been of excellent quality for her clients.
    Maybe that\u2019s where she vanishes after I leave, she hasn\u2019t even been
    trying to hide her disappearing act anymore. I don\u2019t really care anyway,
    as long as I get my money she can do whatever she wants."
