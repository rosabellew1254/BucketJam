  - This month I set a goal for myself to clean up our house storage a little and
    found some old pictures! Clove looks so cute as a baby!

  - "I swung by the well towards the beginning of the month but\u2026 I can\u2019t
    say I\u2019ve been back. When I approached there seemed to be a strange mist
    flowing from the top and I could swear I saw a tentacle creeping around the rim."

  - "I\u2019ve found that leaving the weeds in the ground provide food for my crops.
    Well I won\u2019t complain about one less task to complete, plus it\u2019s entertaining
    to watch the weeds disappear from the crops\u2019 attacks."
