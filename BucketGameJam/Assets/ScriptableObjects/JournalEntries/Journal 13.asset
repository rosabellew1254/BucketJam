  - "During the last month I tried out a few different creative hobbies to keep myself
    busy, like basket weaving and crochet. All of my attempts didn\u2019t turn out
    too well\u2026maybe I\u2019ll just stick to doodling and farming."

  - "It feels like the birds have been acting strange since last month. Their cries
    have become a lot more\u2026 unnerving. And that isn\u2019t even mentioning what
    I think are more eyes along their neck? I haven\u2019t been able to get close
    enough to really tell\u2026"

  - "I can hear the crows squawking outside. Mocking me. Those blasted birds won\u2019t
    be laughing for long\u2026 I hope they like my little treat I\u2019ve left for
    them in the crops. We\u2019ll see who's laughing then."
