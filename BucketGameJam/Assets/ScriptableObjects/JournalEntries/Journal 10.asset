  - "Pandora asked for my help with restocking her shelves. Apparently, her usual
    helpers needed to travel this month and she wasn\u2019t able to find temporary
    replacements. It\u2019s nice to think she trusts me enough to ask for help, and
    she even promised me a meal in exchange! "

  - "Pandora has been acting a little\u2026 off lately. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s
    been going on with her but she\u2019s been a lot more distant and pushy about
    when I complete my crops. I hope she isn\u2019t in any trouble\u2026"

  - During the past month the mist has managed to completely block the sun. Good.
    My crops prefer the dark anyway.
